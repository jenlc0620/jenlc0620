- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jennifer Rodriguez 
       I just graduated and I am looking for projects to build up my experience in different languages to enhance my skills.  
       I am always looking for new things to learn and experiment with.  I have experience with javascript, jquery, css3, html5, debugging, and linux and I would really 
       like to improve on my app building skills.
